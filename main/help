Minishell Help:

Welcome to Minishell, a minimalist shell program with the following features:

1. Display a prompt and wait for a new command.
2. Maintain a functional command history.
3. Search and execute the correct executable based on the PATH environment variable, or a relative or absolute path.
4. Do not interpret unclosed quotes or unrequested special characters, such as backslashes or semicolons.
5. Handle single quotes (') to prevent the shell from interpreting metacharacters within the quoted sequence.
6. Handle double quotes (") to prevent the shell from interpreting metacharacters within the quoted sequence, except for the dollar sign ($).
7. Implement file redirections:
   - '<' redirects input.
   - '>' redirects output.
   - '<<' reads input until a delimiter is encountered (no need to update history).
   - '>>' appends output to a file.
8. Implement pipes (|) to connect the output of one command to the input of the next.
9. Manage environment variables (a $ followed by a sequence of characters) that are substituted with their content.
10. Handle '$?' to be replaced with the exit status of the last foreground pipeline.
11. Manage ctrl-C, ctrl-D, and ctrl-\ as follows:
    - ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
    - ctrl-D exits the shell.
    - ctrl-\ does nothing.
12. In interactive mode, implement the following built-in commands:
    - 'echo' with the '-n' option.
    - 'cd' only with a relative or absolute path.
    - 'pwd' with no options.
    - 'export' with no options.
    - 'unset' with no options.
    - 'env' with no options or arguments.
    - 'exit' with no options.

For more information on specific commands, type 'man <command>' where <command> is the command you want to learn more about.

Minishell is as cute as a real shell and provides basic shell functionality. Enjoy using it!
